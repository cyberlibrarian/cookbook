# Password Assessment Lab
This folder contains practical exercises and supporting data files for learning how to assessment the risk of vulnerable passwords. Primarily this is done through "password cracking" with hashcat.

# Why assess password vulenrability risk?

A weak password is a vulnerable to exploitation. It puts the systems the password gives access to at risk. What is the likelihood that exploiting that vulnerable password could lead to a material impact on the system?

That risk depends on the critical on of the system being protected, upon the type of threats that might exploit it, and upon how weak the password is.

By "cracking" passwords, we can gain insight into the process that caused the password to be vulnerable. Is it too short? Is it too simple? Is it based on something predictable? Is it similar to the account name it protects? Or the company? Or the system or application?
