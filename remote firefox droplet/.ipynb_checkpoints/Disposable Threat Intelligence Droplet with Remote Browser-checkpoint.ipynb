    "## Requirements\n",
    "When performing incident reponse and threat intelligence activities, I frequently need an disposable environment to run Firefox or other tools. I need this environment to be isolated from my own: I want to interact with potentially malicious content that could adversely impact my local system. I need this environment to be disposable, not persistent: I do not want any artifacts from my use today to pollute artificats during future use. It is also helpful if the environment uses IP addresses not easily attributable to me: I don't want threat actors blocking me.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few things to consider that won't work:\n",
    "- A proxy or VPN: code still executes in my environment\n",
    "- A Virtual Machine on my desktop: the malicious environment can still access my network\n",
    "\n",
    "I do have another solution that I use that combines local VMs and a wireguard VPN. It's a little more complicated because I have not automated it yet. This solution is an alternative that is just a touch simpler. I may combine them someday.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed Solution\n",
    "A Digital Ocen Droplet is ideal for my purpose. To make it work we need the following:\n",
    "- A script to automatically create and destroy a Digital Ocean Droplet\n",
    " - I can update this script as needed to add new tools if want them (MITM, BurpSuite etc)\n",
    "- A recipe to configure a Digital Ocean Droplet with \n",
    " - Firefox and Chromium Browser\n",
    " - TigerVNC Server for fast remote desktop, bound to localhost only\n",
    " - A script to launch tigervnc with my desired configuration\n",
    " - SSH will listen on a non-standard port listening on IPv6 only (to prevent brute forcing/discovery)\n",
    " - SSH will be configured with my SSH keys automatically\n",
    " - I will connect to the remote desktop using TigerVNC client OVER SSH\n",
    "  - VNC is secured by SSH... no need for additional authentication/encryption of VNC"

    "- \"digitalocean\"\n",

    "I don't know. I found there were at least 3 python libraries for using the DO API. I choose this one because it was the first I found a well documented set of examples.\n",
